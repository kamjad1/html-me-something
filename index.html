      <p>Hi! This is Kainat Amjad. I was born and brought up by my 
       amazing parents in a small town in Pakistan. I completed my high 
       school and some collge where I studied some basic Psychology in my hometown. 
       Being a small town girl I always believed in the  importance of education. I 
       understand how education can help you in acheiving your dreams. </p>

      <h2> My Journey to Tech World</h2>
       <p>Currently, I am living with my wonderful husband and two beautiful children. 
          As a Stay at home mom with two toddlers, a girl and a boy. I really enjoy spending 
          time with my kids but I wanted to pursue my career in programming. I always wanted to study 
          programming but I going to college full time was not easy for me while taking care of my kids.
            One day I was in my neighborhood, my neighbor came out and we had a litle talk 
         about continuing my education. She realized  that I am into computers and after few days she came to 
         me again with launchcode information. I applied instantly. I could not wait more because this 
         was something I have always wanted, something that I can do while taking care of my family, something that did not 
         ask me about my qualification in college degree. I believe one day I am going to get a job that I love and I am 
         going to work very hard for that.
