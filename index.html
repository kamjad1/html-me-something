                  Hi! This is Kainat Amjad. I was born and brought up by my
                  amazing parents in a small town in Pakistan. I completed my high
                  school and some collge where I studied some basic Psychology in my hometown.
                  Being a small town girl I always believed in the importance of education. I
                  understand how education can help you in acheiving your dreams.

               <h3> My life In United States </h3>
               <p>
                  I came to Saint Louis in 2015. Here I am living with my wonderful husband and two beautiful children.
                  As a Stay at home mom with two toddlers, a girl and a boy. These days due to Covid-19, I homeschool my
                  4 year old. Besides that I love cooking, doing DIY projects with my family together and travelling.

               <h4> My Journey To The Tech World </h4>

               <p>
                  I always wanted to complete my education. I always wanted to study
                  programming but I going to college full time was not easy for me while taking care of my kids.
                  One day I was in my neighborhood, my neighbor came out and we had a litle talk
                  about continuing my education. She realized that I am into computers and after few days she came to
                  me again with launchcode information. I applied instantly. I could not wait more because this
                  was something I have always wanted, something that I can do while taking care of my family, something
                  that
                  did not
                  ask me about my qualification in college degree.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I believe that one day I am going to achieve all that I have been wanting for so long.
               </p>
